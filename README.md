### BetterChunkLoader
This is a plugin for Cauldron-like MC1.7.10 servers that allows players to make chunk loaders.

This was made for big multiplayer servers that need to restrict chunk loaders.

It has an online-only (work only when the player is online), and an always-on chunk loader (works even if the player is offline).

The amount of chunks that can be loaded per player can be set manually with ingame commands.

It provides ingame-commands for admins so they can remove all chunk loaders for a player, and chunk loaders can be disabled by disabling the plugin.

This plugin requires BCLForgeLib, a server-side Forge mod library, so it can be added to any modpack without requiring the mod on client-side.

#### Installation
- Download BetterChunkLoader and place it on the plugins folder
- Download BCLForgeLib and place it on the mods folder

### Commands
Type /bcl for the list of commands and a short description.
